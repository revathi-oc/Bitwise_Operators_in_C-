# Bitwise Operators in C++
## Aim
We learn about bitwise operators in C++.
## Theory
Bitwise operators in C++ are fundamental for manipulating data at the binary level, operating directly on the binary representations of integers. They are often used in tasks that require precise control over individual bits, such as system programming, cryptography, and performance optimization.

The primary bitwise operators include:

1. **AND (&)**: Produces a 1 in the result only if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1, otherwise, it results in 0. This is useful for masking operations, where specific bits of a value need to be isolated.

2. **OR (|)**: Produces a 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1, making it useful for setting specific bits.

3. **XOR (^)**: Produces a 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. XOR is often used in toggling bits or in simple encryption techniques.

4. **NOT (~)**: Inverts all the bits of the operand, turning 1s into 0s and 0s into 1s. This is a unary operator.

5. **Shift operators (<<, >>)**: Left Shift moves bits to the left, filling with 0s, while Right Shift moves bits to the right, with behavior dependent on the type of integer.
